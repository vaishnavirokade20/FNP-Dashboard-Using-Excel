Excited to share my latest Excel Dashboard Project – FNP Sales Analysis! 💡
This dashboard provides a complete view of sales performance with insights such as:
 🏙️ Top 10 cities by orders
 📆 Monthly revenue trends
 🎁 Top 5 products & revenue by occasion
 📦 Quantity-wise revenue distribution
✨ Tools & Techniques Used:
- Power Query Editor for data cleaning & transformation
